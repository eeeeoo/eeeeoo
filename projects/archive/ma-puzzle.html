                  This was initially created as the final project for my class at the MIT Media Lab. Inspired by the Eames brothers' Powers of Ten, the prompt of the project was to create something that demonstrates how the perspective on something can change across a scale, be it time, size, population, data, or any number of others.
              </p>
              <p class="about">
                As the Eames brothers explore the system of exponential powers to picture the importance of scale of area, we dissected the chronological transformation of Chinese characters from the original oracle bone script to today’s tech-assisted usage of simplified characters. The evolution of Chinese characters spans from 1500 BCE to 1956, a rich timeline which spans across three powers of ten in years.

                  The old, poetic act of calligraphy to the automated process we encountered today undoubtedly creates a jarring contrast. By investigating the scales of Chinese characters, we hope to pose questions on  how our language decisions reflect today’s issues of digitization and culture.

              <h4>Learning the Historical Background</h4>
              <p class="feature body-text">
                  Starting with hieroglyphic pictograms carved on oracle bones, Chinese characters continuously evolved around these original forms but maintained the essential integrity. 
                  Gradually, the language began to rely on ink, then Pinyin (romanization of the characters based on pronunciation), 
                  then technology. Some three thousand years later in the digital age, the experience of the Chinese language has become totally different.                  
                  Cloud computing predicts the user’s input, voice recognition eliminates the need to learn written word. We are living in a pivotal moment in this history, where writing Chinese is no longer necessary.

                  <p class="feature body-text">
                    Even as Chinese characters are relatively ubiquitous all around the world, very few people outside of the Chinese cultural tradition are aware of the absolutely organic, stunning, and well-documented transformation that the written language has undergone. By retracing steps that occurred over thousands of years, one can clearly see how the modern simplified script is directly descended from its pictographic beginnings -- characters found carved on turtle bones from ancient times.

                  <p class="feature body-text">
                    In a way, the transformation we were hoping to document can be seen as an organic design process that was simply pushed by time. As people from different eras had different materials and demands, they gradually adapted tradition to their temporalities. It was important for us to leverage our particular technological moment and represent this with appropriate abstraction.

              <p class="feature-title">Creating the Mǎnual</p>
              <p class="feature body-text">
                We knew we wanted to create an educational product that directly interacted with users, since that’s the best way to make an idea stick. We went through several iterations, including the "Mǎnual" pictured below. This was a manual that contained instructions for users to simulate the separate experiences of interacting with Chinese written language at different points in time. For example, an early Oracle Bone script simulation would instruct users to actually try to carve into a piece of acrylic or stone.

              <h4>Designing the Interaction</h4>
              <p class="feature body-text">
                To simplify the interaction, we took another look at the actual characters whose transformation we were hoping to emphasize. We realized that when you simply lay them next to each other, the lineage is extremely self-explanatory and linear - we did not need a wordy and convoluted manual - these characters are able to tell their own story.
              </p>

              <br>
              <p class="feature body-text">
                However, it was still not enough to just lay them out in 2D. We finally decided that a “puzzle set” would allow the user to internalize the shape, strokes, and overall structure of each character as they put the pieces together. The delicateness of the pieces were an intentional design decision, as it prompts the user to carefully separate the shapes out from each other and have an opportunity to look distinguish the forms from one another.
