          <h3>Project Brief</h3>
          <p class="body-text">
              <br>
            “Where am I” is a question we often ask ourselves, even
though we might not be lost geographically. It is a question that
examines our relationship between ourselves and our surroundings.
We feel a sense of insecurity when we are lost in space. It is
interesting how we get accustomed to spaces, how we navigate
it, mind map spaces, and know directions without having to look
at a map. People get comfortable with spaces, but how doe we
reach that phase? Finding one’s way through the campus of
Wellesley can be confusing as first years or for people who might
not often visit certain parts of the campus. WhereAmI is a project
of pedestrian signage developed by incorporating anthropological
thinking into design to navigate the Wellesley College campus.
            <br>
              <br>
Maps guide people to bus stations and understand where
people are located on campus. By protecting the natural beauty
of the Wellesley campus, WhereAmI takes the existing lampposts
on campus to create signs that conserve the aesthetic style of the
lamppost and Wellesley. By attaching bus signs and qr codes on
the lampposts, the lampposts allow people to use digital services to
scan qr codes to know their current location.
              <br>
              <br>
I aim to translate my understanding of Wellesley into real
experiences for people by trying to solve the problem of navigating
within campus by using my experience, knowledge, and available
tools in Wellesley. WhereAmI hopes to improve people’s
navigation and accessibility to areas by mediating the strange and
familiar, the new and old, by using the recognisable lamppost with
a new signage that uses digital services.

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p class="body-text">
              Wellesley College is divided not only geographically by
east and west campus, but also the dorms and the humanities
and sciences are also divided. Students majoring in science might
not be fully aware of the dorms or classrooms on the west side.
Especially for first years, as students who are learning to navigate
the campus may find it hard to navigate the campus while
walking.
<br>
<br>
Wellesley students use transportation systems such as bikes,
buses, and cars, but mainly students walk from five to twenty
minutes to walk around campus. WhereAmI focuses on people
who are walking through the paths along with the lampposts and
can discover their location by using digital applications to scan
the qr codes. WhereAmI also improves bus stop information by
updating time schedules for the buses, because many students
have experienced confusion due to the general lack of guidance
for bus stops. There is no official bus stop sign in front of the bus
stops and the time schedules are only available online, which is
inconvenient for pedestrians.
 <br>
<br>               
The Wellesley lamppost, first introduced in the 1920s,
continues to represent an iconic element and constant variable in
the college environment regardless of the changes in nature. The
lamppost acts beyond the function as a lighting fixture, and has
transformed into a tourist landmark, where people take photos,
sell merchandise of lampposts, and even get tattoos to show
school pride. They carry a presence in Wellesley. Although many
lampposts appear “planted” along the sidewalks of Wellesley, they
are not objects, but things embodied with the pride of Wellesley
(McMillin, 264). Lampposts have become a reification of
Wellesley College and its ideologies. The history of lamppost is also
contained within the Wellesley College student’s souls.

              <h3>The Strategy</h3>
              <p class="body-text">
                WhereAmI potentially raises questions of bias, because
I'm coming from an emic approach as a Wellesley student,
an insider part of the cultural system. It was important to put
aside subjective opinions, but WhereAmI would not have been
developed without an emic approach. Understanding the culture
of Wellesley and the problems with the navigation occurred due
to my experience at Wellesley.
                  <br>
                  <br>
The project takes wayfinding, a method using a
visual language to communicate how to navigate space
(“Wayfinding”). Wayfinding utilises signs to support seamless
journeys in a perplexing environment. Signs make a space into a
place, because signs acknowledge the space embodies a certain
value and recognition to be labeled and founded by others.
Signs can be controlling and demanding, but people follow
and trust signs to make decisions. Or are we even making our
own decisions? How do we trust signs? Nothing has inherent
meaning until we give it meaning. We must understand how
signs and maps are abstractions, not a representation of the
territory. Signage is all about the power we give in. If the
lampposts were placed in a different context, would the meaning
still be same or would the space in Wellesley be the same?

              <h3>Design Solution</h3>
              <p class="body-text">
                I wanted to create a universal design within the Wellesley
                  community that would be appropriate to all locations
                  within the campus without interfering the campus. Without
                  creating separate monoliths in the campus and preserving
                  the natural beauty of the campus, signs were created
                  based on the vernacular design of Wellesley. Shift from
                  vernacular architecture damages culture, so I tried to keep the vernacular style of Wellesley and the lamppost by using a specific color schemes.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  The “Wellesley Blue” color and class colors are
important components that reflect the visual identity
of Wellesley college. For the bus stop signs, the bus
information uses the four class colors to represent the
different bus stations and the container that holds the signs
appropriate the design of the lampposts. The bus stop signs
also has multiple sides like the lamppost, so the design of
the lamppost and sign would blend together. In addition,
the bus stop signs and qr code signs both use black, so it
can blend with the black lamppost. In order to bridge the
familiar lamppost with unfamiliar signs, or old lamppost
with new signs, the design needs to assimilate with the
original design.

                <p class="body-text">Furthermore, other design considerations were the accessibility, resisability, and readability of the signs. I went to the Wellesley College Archives and Special Collections room to discover that height of the lamppost is approximately one sixty-one inches. I used the information to understand the appropriate height of the signs that would be attached to the lamppost. Assuming the majority of the students would identify their gender as female, I took the average height for women in the United States to create an approximate placement for the eyes and hands for the signs in ratio to the height of the lamppost. More importantly, the signs were not placed at the bottom of the lamppost, because of the snowy weather in Wellesley. The signs are to be water resistant, so the qr codes can be scanned and the bus information is readable.</p>
